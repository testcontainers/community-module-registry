  This module allows provisioning the Ceph server as a standalone container within your tests based on [Ceph Demo Container](https://github.com/ceph/ceph-container).

  Ceph, also known as Ceph Storage, is an open-source storage platform designed to provide
  highly scalable object, block, and file storage in a unified system.
  Developed by Inktank Storage (which was acquired by Red Hat in 2014),
  it is intended to help organizations manage vast amounts of data with a high level of fault tolerance and seamless scalability.
  Ceph allows enterprises and service providers to install a distributed storage infrastructure with both performance and resilience.
